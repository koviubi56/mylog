# Contributing guidlines

First off, thank you for considering contributing.

## Why is this guildline exists?

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of

they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing

## What to do

mylog is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our
community! There are many ways to contribute, from improving the
documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code.

- Read the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- Run tests.
- Search open **and closed** issues **and** pull requests.
- Please, **don't** open an issue for questions. Ask it in the discussions tab!
- Make sure to put an X to the square brackets at the end of the issue, if you
  agree to the contributing guidlines, the code of conduct, and the DCO.
  **If you don't put an X to all of them, your issue will be closed!**

## Priority

### Small

- Spelling / grammar fixes
- Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
- Comment clean up
- Adding logging messages or debugging output

### Medium

- Bug fixes that fix errors that maked a part of the program buggy/unuseable.
- New features

### High

- Bug fixes that fix errors that maked the whole program buggy/unuseable.
- Security vulnerabilities

## Security vulnerabilities

In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask
yourself these two questions:

- Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access
  to?
- Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably
dealing with a security issue. _Note that even if you answer "no" to both
questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue._

How to report them can be found in the [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) file.
