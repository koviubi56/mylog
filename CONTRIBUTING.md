## Security vulnerabilities

In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask
yourself these two questions:

- Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access
  to?
- Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably
dealing with a security issue. _Note that even if you answer "no" to both
questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue._

How to report them can be found in the [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) file.
